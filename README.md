## My process
At first i needed to make a container that could hold the necessary contents.So i started with block level element div. Inside the msin container i created three block level sub containers.The first one holds learning tag and the paragraph, the second one holds heading and the paragraph and the third one hold the image avatar and the name of the author. Then i started styling each one of them. I applied flexbox on the main container and aligned each contents to the baseline. Then i did the same for the other block level div as well except for the last one on which, i applied row directional flex. In this way my desktop view was complete. Now it was time for mobile view for which i had to make it responsive.
As i am a windows user i faced problem with chrome browser since it was not at all allowing me to get closer to my design. Initially i was confused but later on started building it and at some where i found that my svg image was not at all following the properties that i gave under the css media. Later on i found out the problem did arise because of view box property so i removed it from the svg tag of html page and in this way that probblem was solved. And rest other properties were same except for margin and width. In this way i completed the challenge


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Through this challenge i learnt about 'svg' and how it is used and what 'viewbox' attrinute does. I also learnt to make responsive design that involves the use of 'svg'.



### Continued development

I am happy to work on projects like these as it teaches me new things that i need to know. I look forward to get projects like these which could levelup my designer coding skills.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me in knowing more about svg tag. I really liked their explanation and i will follow their patterns in future as well.
